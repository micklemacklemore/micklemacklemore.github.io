A two week solo project. 

This is a Path Tracer written in C++ and CUDA which utilizes GPU hardware. This is an interactive renderer that interops with OpenGL. It uses fundamental BSDF models such as diffuse, perfect specular, specular transmission and Cook-Torrance microfacet model. It supports glTF scene loading and has Open Intel Denoising Integration.

Part of CIS 5650: GPU Programming.
