Signed Distance Field Global Illumination (SDFGI) is a solution to **real-time diffuse global illumination for games, that doesn't require the use of RTX hardware to be performant.**

Over 4 weeks, in a team of 3, I developed a variant of Dynamic Diffuse Global Illumination (DDGI) that takes advantage of Signed Distance Fields. 

This is a DirectX12 implementation built on top of a starter project provided my Microsoft, MiniEngine, as part of their DirectX Samples repo.
