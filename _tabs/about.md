I'm a software engineer with 3 years of experience as an animation TD in the visual effects + animation industry!

Currently, I'm in grad school at the University of Pennsylvania, where I'm in my dream master's program: dual master's degree in Computer Science and Computer Graphics, graduating in 2025.

I've been a student volunteer at the world's largest computer graphics conference, SIGGRAPH, since 2019. I'm passionate about graphics and related industries: vfx, animation and video games.
